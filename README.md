Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression

Project Overview

Welcome to the Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression project! This repository contains the code and documentation for building a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various features using the fundamental machine learning algorithmâ€”linear regression. This project is designed to provide hands-on experience in data collection, exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, main road access, guestroom availability, basement presence, hot water heating, air conditioning, parking spaces, preferred area, and furnishing status.

Project Steps

1. Data Collection

Obtain the dataset containing numerical features and the target variable (house prices).

2. Data Exploration and Cleaning

a. Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

b. Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.

c. Explore the dataset's structure and statistics to understand the distribution of features.

3. Feature Selection and Preprocessing

a. Identify relevant features that influence house prices.

b. Convert categorical features into numerical values using one-hot encoding.

4. Model Training

a. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

b. Implement linear regression using Scikit-Learn.

c. Train the model on the training set.

5. Model Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

6. Visualization

Create visualizations to illustrate the relationship between the predicted and actual values.

Learning Objectives

a. Understand linear regression concepts.

b. Gain practical experience in implementing a predictive model.

c. Develop model evaluation and interpretation skills.

Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive understanding of the process involved in building a predictive model using linear regression. It covers essential steps from data collection to model evaluation and visualization, enhancing skills in data analysis and machine learning.
